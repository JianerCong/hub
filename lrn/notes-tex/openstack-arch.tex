\section{Architecture}

\subsection{scope}

\dSay{
  Okay. If we wanna deploy a cloud, what do we need to do? And what does OpenStack-Ansible provide?
}

\cSay{
  We need to:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item prepare the OS
  \item create the bridge for networking
  \end{enumerate}
}

\subsection{Ansible and Roles}

\colz{
  All roles are \cola{independent} and can be used separately.

  All roles are built as \Cola{Galaxy comptible roles} even if some of them are not
  intended to work independently.
}

\dSay{
  What's Galaxy?
}

\cSay{
  ``Docker Hub ''
  for Ansible roles. \url{https://galaxy.ansible.com/}.
}

\subsection{Containers}

Many OpenStack services are deployed in containers. But some services are not, such as
\begin{enumerate}
\item Nova Compute
\item Swift Storage
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Security and Service availability}

Some services are available to all users, for example:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Nova Compute
\item Swift Object Storage
\item Neutron Networking
\item Glance Image Service
\end{enumerate}

while some services are only available
to the admin:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Keystone Identity Service
\item MariaDB
\item Memcached
\item RabbitMQ
\end{enumerate}
