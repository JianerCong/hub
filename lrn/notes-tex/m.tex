\section{Media Access Control (MAC) Address}

\subsection{what does it look like}

MAC address has format something like: \texttt{00-0c-29-3b-73-cb}

\cSay{
  In practice, these addresses are used to communicate between hosts in the
  same VLAN or subnet. If you look at a packet capture, at the start of a TCP
  conversation you'll see the sending host send a broadcast \Cola{ARP request} saying
  \begin{center}
    ``Who has IP address x.x.x.x ?''
  \end{center}
  The \Cola{ARP reply} from some host will be
  \begin{center}
    ``That's me, and my MAC address is aaaa.bbbb.cccc ?''
  \end{center}
}

\dSay{
  What if the target IP is on a different subnet ?
}

\cSay{
  Then the sender will \Cola{ARP for} the gateway for that subnet.

  Switch is much faster than router, because hosts can use MAC to communicate.
}

\dSay{So why router ?}

\cSay{
  Because switches only work in LAN.
}

\subsection{Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI)}

\cSay{The leading (usually 3 ) bytes of a MAC address usually points to its
  manufacturer, like \texttt{OOtronics Ltd. Kibbutz Yizrael, IL} or \texttt{OOel Corporate Kedah,
    MY} see \url{https://standards-oui.ieee.org/oui/oui.txt}
}

\subsection{Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)}

\Cola{ARP} is used to find the MAC address of a network neighbour for a given IPv4 Address.

\cSay{
  When a host wants to \cola{talk} to another host \cola{in the same subnet} using its IP address, it will
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item check its \Cola{ARP cache} to see whether there's a MAC address that matches that IP.
  \item If there isn't, it will send an ARP request to the local broadcast address.
  \item When the corresponding MAC is found, it will \colb{establish port-to-port communications (Next)}.
  \end{enumerate}
}

\section{Port to Port : TCP and UDP}

\cSay{There're two types of ports:
  \begin{description}
  \item[fixed server ports:] $0 <= p <= 1023$ usually for \cola{server}
  \item[ephemeral (short-lived) ports:] $1024 <= p <= 65535$ usually for
    \cola{client}. Among them, we have
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $1024 <= p <= 49151$ user ports
    \item $49152  <= p <= 65535$ dynamic or private ports
    \end{itemize}
  \end{description}
}


\section{DNS}

\subsection{public DNS}

DNS has a large and complex infrastructure on the internet. This is made up of
\begin{itemize}
\item 13 \cola{root name servers}(which are each a reliable cluster
  of servers)
\item a group of commonly used name servers (for instance, the servers at Google or Cloudflare)
\item a series of registrars who will, for a fee, register a DNS domain name for
  you -- for instance, your organization's domain name.
\end{itemize}

\dSay{So Route 53 service in AWS is one of the third kind}

\cSay{I guess so.}

\dSay{Who are the 13 clusters?}

\cSay{
  They answer you questions liks : ``Where is the \texttt{.com} server?''
  \colz{(These servers are called \Cola{top-level domain (TLD)} authoritative name
    server.)
    In face, all 13 root (clusters of) servers  are same for redundancy.
    They are listed in \url{https://www.iana.org/domains/root/servers}. For example,
    Verisign,Inc, Department of Defence, NASA,...
  }
}

\dSay{
  Oh, do they need a consensus mechanism then ?
}

\cSay{
  I think say do. But let's stop.
}

\subsection{internal DNS}
\cSay{

  \colz{
    However, for the most part, most administrators are working with the needs of
    their organization -- working with their \Cola{internal DNS} name servers that
    face their internal folks, or with their \colb{external DNS} name servers that
    face the internet. 
  }

}

The internal DNS server has a \Cola{zone file} populated with DNS records for internal
DNS resolution. This file can either be populated
\begin{itemize}
\item manually by editing it
\item automatically by the clients
\item automatically by \Cola{Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) leases}.
\end{itemize}

\cSay{Often, all three methods are combined.}

\subsubsection{basic request flow}


The basic request flow is simple. A client makes a DNS request. \cola{If that
  request is for a host that's internal to the organization and the request is
  to an internal DNS server,} the DNS response is supplied immediately since
it's on that local DNS server.

If it's for an external host, then things are bit more complex -- for instance,
let's query for \texttt{www.example.com}.

\begin{tikzpicture}
  % \draw[step=1cm,help lines,] (0,0) grid +(15cm,10cm);
  
  \tikzstyle{dnsStyle}=[inner sep=7pt,fill=\mycola!20,rounded corners,

  % \draw[->] (M1-1-1.west) .. controls +(left:5mm) and +(left:10mm) ..  (M1-2-1.west);

      \refPlusPlus{}
    } (#2);

    \draw[-latex] (#2) to[out = 0, in=0] node[auto,swap] {
      \refPlusPlus{}
    } (#1);
  }

  
  % over the wall
  \draw[-latex] (internal-dns) to[out=180,in=0]
  node [midway, left] {\refPlusPlus{}}
  (M1-1-1);


  % pass around
  \comeAndGo{M1-1-1}{M1-2-1}{2}{3}
  \comeAndGo{M1-1-1}{M1-3-1}{4}{5}
  \comeAndGo{M1-1-1}{M1-4-1}{6}{7}

  % go back  in wall
  \draw[-latex] (M1-1-1) to[out=90,in=90]
  node [midway, left] {\refPlusPlus{}}
  (internal-dns);

  % back to us
  \draw[-latex] (internal-dns) to[out=90,in=90]
  node [midway, left] {\refPlusPlus{}}
  (we);
  
\end{tikzpicture}

The worst-case process is as follows:

\newcommand{\goTo}[1]{$\Rightarrow $ Step #1}
\begin{enumerate}
\item If the entry is in the \cola{DNS cache} of the \cola{internal DNS server},
  and the \Cola{time to live (TTL)} of that entry has not expired, then the
  response is supplied \cola{immediately }to the client.

  Similarly, if the client is requesting an entry that's hosted on the server in
  a \Cola{zone file}, the answer is supplied immediately to the client.
\colz{  (\emoji{parrot} : So it feels like the zone file holds the ``defined DNS
  entries'', and the cache holds entries of ``somebody else's zone file's
  entry''?, \emoji{turtle} : Seem so....)}
\item If the entry is not in the cache of the internal DNS server, or if it's
  expired, then the server \cola{forwards the request} to its \Cola{upstream
    providers} (often called \Cola{forwarders}) to refresh the entry.

  If the query is in the \cola{cache} of the forwarder, it will simply return the
  answer. If not found, \goTo{3}.

  If this server has the \cola{authoritative name server} for the domain, it
  will simply query that host (\goTo{5}).
\item Forwarder request upstream. In this case, though, it will likely query the
  \Cola{root name servers}.
\colz{  The goal in this is to find the ``authoritative name
  server'' that has the actual entries (in a zone file) for that domain. In this
  case, the query is made to the root name servers for \texttt{.com}.}
  % \goTo{4}
\item The \Cola{root name server} will not return the actual answer, but will
  instead return the authoritative name server for the \Cola{top-level domain
    (TLD)} -- in this case, for \texttt{.com}. 
  \colz{(
    \emoji{parrot} : Oh, so this is
    the server that you can ask ``Who should I ask for \texttt{.com} name''.
    \emoji{turtle} : Yeah.)}
\item After the forwarder gets this response, it updates its \cola{cache} with
  that \cola{name server entry}, then makes the actual query against that
  server. \colz{(\emoji{parrot} : Oh, so there's a cache entry just for the \texttt{.com} name
  server. \emoji{turtle} : If you can cache \texttt{www.example.com}, why not
  \texttt{.com}? \emoji{parrot} : Oh...)}
\item The authoritative server for \texttt{.com} returns the authoritative DNS
  server for \texttt{example.com}.
\item
\colz{\colZ{The forwarder server} then makes a request against this \colZ{final authoritative name server}.}
\item
\colz{The \colZ{authoritative name server} for \colZ{\texttt{example.com}} returns the actual query
  ``answer'' to the \colZ{forwarder server}.}
\item \colz{The \colZ{forwarder name server} caches that answer, then sends a reply back to
  your \colZ{internal name server}.}
\item \colz{Your \colZ{internal DNS server }also caches that answer, then
    forwards it back to the client. The \colZ{client} caches the request in its
    local cache, then passes the requested information (the DNS response) to the
    application that requested it (perhaps your web browser)}. (\emoji{parrot} :
  This is like ``backward propagation?'' \emoji{turtle} : No, not at all. They
  just return the previously asked requests....)
\end{enumerate}

\cSay{ \colz{
    Again, this process shows the \colZ{worst-case}. In practice, once the
    servers have been up for even a short period of time, caching shortens this
    \colZ{considerably}. Once in a steady state, the \colZ{internal DNS server}
    for most organizations will have most requests cached.
  }
}

\dSay{So usually just two steps. Right?}

\cSay{Yeah.
  \colz{
    In addition, your \colZ{forwarding DNS server} will cache -- in particular,
    it will almost never query the root name servers; usually, it will have \colZ{the
    TLD servers (in this case, the server for \texttt{.com} cached as well.)}
  }
}

\end{comment}


\subsubsection{needed features}
\dSay{
  \colz{
    Which key features fo we need to enable on our \colZ{internal DNS server} to make
    all this work?
  }
}

\cSay{We need:}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item DNS recursion: \colz{This model relies on DNS recursion -- the
      ability for each server in turn to make the client's DNS request ``up the
      line''. }
  \item Forwarder entries: \colz{If the requested DNS entry is not hosted on the
    internal server, \Cola{internal DNS service (iDNS)} requests are forwarded
    to these configured IP addresses -- these should be two or more reliable
    upstream DNS servers.

    These upstream servers will in turn cache DNS entries.

    In days past, people would use their \colZ{internet service provider's (ISP)
      (e.g. \texttt{OO Telecom})} DNS servers for forwarders. In more modern
    times, the larger DNS providers are both more reliable and provide more
    features. Some are shown in \cref{tab:dns-prov}
  }
\item Caching: \colz{Just cache what it knows.}
\item Dynamic registration: \colz{While server usually have static IP addresses
    and static DNS entries, it's common for client hosts to have addresses
    assigned by DHCP, and having those hosts in DNS would be nice.

    DNS is often configured to allow dynamic registration of these hosts, either
    by populating DNS from DHCP addresses as they are assigned or by permitting
    the hosts to register themselves in DNS.

    Microsoft implements an authentication mechanism into their dynamic update
    process, and this is where it is most commonly seen. It is, however, an
    option in Linux DNS \colZ{(Berkeley Internet Name Domain, or BIND)} as well.
  }
\item Host redundancy: \colz{Please get a backup.}

\subsection{internet-facing DNS server}

\dSay{
  \colz{
    So how to make a DNS server to serve a public zone ? For example, if I already
    have \texttt{aaa.com} as our domain, how can we serve \texttt{bbb.aaa.com}?
  }
}

\cSay{
  \colz{
    For a public-facing DNS server, \colZ{security} matters more than
    \colZ{efficiency.}
  }
  In particular, we might implement:
}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Restrict recursion: \colz{This server should \colZ{answer the request directly}.
    It doesn't forward it. }
\item Cache is less important : \colz{Similar reason. This server is about
    \colZ{answering}, not \colZ{asking}.}
\item Host redundancy: \colZ{Please get a back up...}
\item Restricting zone transfers:
\colZ{  You might want to answer individual DNS
  queries as they arrive. There isn't a good reason for a DNS client on the
  internet to request all entries for an organization. (\emoji{parrot} : What
  does it mean..?)
}
