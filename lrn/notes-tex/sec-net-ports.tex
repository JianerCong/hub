\cSay{There're two types of ports:
  \begin{description}
  \item[fixed server ports:] $0 <= p <= 1023$ usually for \cola{server}
  \item[ephemeral (short-lived) ports:] $1024 <= p <= 65535$ usually for
    \cola{client}. Among them, we have
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $1024 <= p <= 49151$ user ports
    \item $49152  <= p <= 65535$ dynamic or private ports
    \end{itemize}
  \end{description}
