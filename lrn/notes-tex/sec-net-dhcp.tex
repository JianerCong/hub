\section{DHCP}
\label{sec:dhcp}

DHCP uses UDP. The client uses a link-local address (obtained from whatever
means) to send a DHCP message to a \cola{reserved multicast address}. Then the server will answer it.


% We will want to consider what we need for special purpose devices such as
% iPhones, \Cola{Wireless Access Points (WAP)}, or even \Cola{Pre Execution
% Environment (PXE)} devices that can load their entire OS from DHCP
% information.
