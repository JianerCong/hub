// A variable is a symbolic name for a value.
// Variables are declared with the let keyword:
let x;                     // Declare a variable named x.

// Values can be assigned to variables with an = sign
x = 0;                     // Now the variable x has the value 0
x                          // => 0: A variable evaluates to its value.

// JavaScript supports several types of values
x = 1;                     // Numbers.
x = 0.01;                  // Numbers can be integers or reals.
x = "hello world";         // Strings of text in quotation marks.
x = 'JavaScript';          // Single quote marks also delimit strings.
x = true;                  // A Boolean value.
x = false;                 // The other Boolean value.
x = null;                  // Null is a special value that means "no value."
x = undefined;             // Undefined is another special value like null.
