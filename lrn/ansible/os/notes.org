** prepare the host
🦜 : To prepare a host do the following first:
1. shell into the host using ~here.sh~
2. on the host, execute 01,02,03 respectively to configure things (this should
   configure the appropriate addresses)

** openstack
*** 2. prepare the target host
1. Install UBuntu 22
2. Configure at least one network iface to access the internet or suitable local
  repositories
3. Remove the 127.0.1.1 loopback in ~/etc/hosts~ if exists
4. configure:
  #+begin_src bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt dist-upgrade
    sudo apt install bridge-utils debootstrap openssh-server \
        tcpdump vlan python3
    sudo apt install linux-modules-extra-$(uname -r)
    # reboot
  #+end_src
5. (for ubuntu) set the passwd of ~root~. This enables the login as ~root~.
  #+begin_src bash
    sudo passwd root
  #+end_src
6. configure ssh keys in ~/root/.ssh/authorized_keys~ so that ansible can access.

  OpenStack-Ansible deployments require the presence of a
  ~/root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub~ file on the ~deployment host~. The content of this
  file is inserted into an ~authorized_keys~ file for the containers, which is a
  necessary step for the Ansible playbooks.

  🦜 : What if I wanna override this file on the deployment host.

  🐢 : set ~lxc_container_ssh_key=/home/me/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub~

7. Configure the storage.

   🦜 : Okay, let's talk about storage....
