* Rasterisation Overview
** Clip Space Transformation
The _clipspace_ and the _clip coordinates_ (X,Y,Z,W[the extents of clipspace for
this vertex.]).

_Normalized device coordinates_ : all (X,Y,Z) in [-1,1]
** Window Transformation
From _Normalized device coordinates_ to _window coordinates_ (relative to the
window that the OpenGL is running within.).

Still (X,Y,Z) => (right, up, away). Still float numbers, so no lost in precision
yet. 
*** Limits
Z in [0,1(farthest)]
bottom-left is (0,0)
