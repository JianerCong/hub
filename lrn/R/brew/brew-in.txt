You won't see this R output, but it will run. <% x <- 123 %>
Now x is <%=x%> and today is <%=format(Sys.time(),'%B %d, %Y')%>.
<%# Comment -- ignored -- useful in testing.
Also notice the dash-percent-gt.
It chops off the trailing newline.
You can add it to any percent-gt. -%>
How about generating a template from a template?
<%% x <- 'fee fi fo fum' %%>
x is still <%=x%>.
