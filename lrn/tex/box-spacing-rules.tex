This is my first plain \TeX{} document. Here's an example of a ``description list''.

\bigskip

%% Call the indentation for description \myi (my-indentation)

\newdimen\myi \myi = 8pc

{\noindent \leftskip = \myi \parskip = .5 \baselineskip
% Move the description to the left of the paragraph
\llap{\hbox to \myi{\bf Queen of Hearts\hfill}} An ill-tempered woman, prone to
saying ``Off with his head''\ at the slightest provocation.
\par \noindent \llap{\hbox to \myi{\bf Modck Turtle\hfill}} A lachrymose creature, quite a
storyteller, who was companion to Gryphon. Reputely the principal ingredient of Mock Turtle Soup.
. \par }

\bigskip\hrule\bigskip        
Here's an example of some words in a ruled box.
\bigskip
% put 8pt space between the text and the surrounding rules.
\hbox{\vrule
  \vbox{\hrule
     \hbox spread 8pt{\hfil
           \vbox spread 8pt{ \vfil
                \hbox{Here is Edward Bear, coming downstars now, bump, bump, bump,}
                \hbox{on the back of his head
                , behind Christopher Robin.}
                \hbox{It is, as fae as he knoews, the only way of coming downstars, }
                \hbox{but sometimes
                her feels that there really is another way. if only her could stop bumping and think of it.}
                \vfil
           }
     \hfil}

         Winnie-the-Pooh. When I first heard his name, I said, just as you are goinf to say, ``But I thought
         he was a boy?''
         ``So did I,'' said Christopher Robin.
         }
