The ~magic comments~ in a file declares the following defun as autoloaded.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;;;###autoload
(defun f () 1)
#+END_SRC
Then calls to ~(update-file-autoloads)~ or ~(update-directory-autoloads)~ will
*process* the magic comments in this file (or all files in the directory) and
generate a ~loadsdefs.el~, which contains the ~(autoload)~ statements.
