* Images
Figure [[psy]] is a psyduck. Figure [[psy2]] is another one, but they used different
options to import.

#+NAME: psy
#+CAPTION: a psyduck rotated 90 \(^\circ\)
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 5cm :options angle=90
[[./psyduck.jpeg]]

#+NAME: psy2
#+CAPTION: a normal psyduck that took \(0.2\) ~textwidth~
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.2\textwidth
[[file:psyduck.jpeg]]

When captions follow the method as described in Captions, the LaTeX export
back-end wraps the picture in a floating ‘figure’ environment. To float an image
without specifying a caption, set the ‘:float’ attribute to one of the
following:


#+NAME: psy3
#+CAPTION: a normal wrapping psyduck 
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float wrap :width 0.38\textwidth :placement {r}{0.4\textwidth}
[[./psyduck.jpeg]]

‘t’ For a standard ‘figure’ environment; used by default whenever an
image has a caption. ‘multicolumn’ To span the image across multiple columns of
a page; the back-end wraps the image in a ‘figure*’ environment. ‘wrap’ For text
to flow around the image on the right; the figure occupies the left half of the
page. ‘sideways’ For a new page with the image sideways, rotated ninety degrees,
in a ‘sidewaysfigure’ environment; overrides ‘:placement’ setting. ‘nil’ To
avoid a ‘:float’ even if using a caption.

The LaTeX export back-end centers all images by default. Setting ‘:center’ to
‘nil’ disables centering. To disable centering globally, set
org-latex-images-centered to ‘nil’. Such as in Figure [[psy4]].

#+NAME: psy4
#+CAPTION: a non-centered psyduck
#+ATTR_LATEX: :center nil
[[./psyduck.jpeg]]

Set the ‘:comment-include’ attribute to non-nil value for the LaTeX export
back-end to comment out the ~‘\includegraphics’~ macro.

* Conclusion
Yep, that's all.
