* Intro
This is a simple org file without any meaning. Below is a simple list, which
just contains some random item that you should not spend any time and energy on:

1. I am not a simple item.
2. Me neither.
3. No you both are.

The following is a useless table. I can refer to the Table [[My_Table]].

#+NAME: My_Table
#+CAPTION: This is the caption for the next table (or link)
| Col1   | Col2   |
|--------+--------|
| cell11 | cell21 |
| cell12 | cell22 |

Following is a quote:

    I do not believe in motivational quote.

Following is a source code:

#+begin_src csharp
int a = 1;
#+end_src

And a figure, the name is Figure [[fig:pysduck]].

#+CAPTION: This is a pysduck
#+NAME:   fig:pysduck
[[./pysduck.jpeg]]


To see different font, we have ~curly braces~, *bold faced* , _underlined_ and
math like this \(x + y = 1\)
* More settings
** How to change class
To use another documentclass, set the following options
#+begin_src txt
#+LATEX_CLASS: myclass
#+LATEX_CLASS_OPTIONS: red
# Use \documentclass[red]{myclass}
#+end_src
But before you set the value, you might wanna tell org how to use this class. In
particular, how the sections should be input. Therefore you should first push
these info into the following variable:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  org-latex-classes                       ;(("article" ...) ("report" ...) ("book" ...))
#+end_src
To teach org about your ~myclass.cls~, do something like:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq x (car org-latex-classes))        ;get what org knows about 'article'
  ;; tell the org to treat `myclass' just like `article'
  (setf (car x) "myclass" (car (cdr x)) "\\documentclass{myclass}")
  (add-to-list 'org-latex-classes x)
#+end_src
* Quoted LaTeX Code
There're many ways to insert LaTeX code such as @@latex: \tikz \fill[orange]
(1ex,1ex) circle (1ex); @@, Or things like
#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
\tikz \draw[thick, rounded corners=8pt]
(0,0) -- (0,2) -- (1,3.25) -- (2,2) -- (2,0) -- (0,2) -- (2,2) -- (0,0) -- (2,0);
#+END_EXPORT
Or something like 
#+LATEX: \emph{I am in \LaTeX{}.}
Now I am in ~org~.
* Conclusion
Yep, that's all.
