** Jungle
.....
+ But this is no Eden.
+ Humming birds are as light as a sheet of paper. 蜂鸟和纸一样轻
+ what they lack in size, they make up for in aggression. 人小胆大

+ Some have dagger-like bills[builds?], and even teeth. {=a bird's beak}
+ All for fighting over flowers. 武器

+ Humming birds have to refuel every few minutes.
+ With feathered[feather] tongues, they lap-up nectar 20 times a second.{the cat
  began to lap up the milk} 快
+ And they need to be quick.
+ The competition is relentless.

--------------------------------------------------

+ But it dosen't have to be like this.
+ The crescent-shaped flowers of heliconia[哈勒口尼亚] are impossible for most
  hummingbirds to feed from. 蝎尾蕉
+ But the green hermit[her-mit] has a [老城堡]long curved bills[build?]. 绿隐蜂鸟
+ It allows it to feed on the nectar in peace. {[an animal]usually eat that food}
+ Well, almost.

+ Tinier than a pin-head, these flower-mites have nearly drunk this [哈勒口尼亚]
  dry. 花螨虫
+ To reach the next flower, they need to hitch a lift.
+ For their size, they are almost as fast as a cheetah.
+ Racing up the humming bird's beak to stow[stol] away in its nostrils[纳斯愁思].
  {to hide on a vehicle in order to travel secretly or without paying 偷偷乘车}
  {one of the two holes at the end of your nose}.

+ Ready to be air-lifted on to the next flower.
