** Jungle
+ A disaster for some, is a windfall for others. {an amount of money that you
  get unexpectedly}
+ Leaf-cutter ants no-longer have to climb.
+ The leafs are many times their size.
+ But each ant can carry ten-times their own weight.
+ And a colony of 8 million, can strip a tree like this, in a matter of days.
+ The fallen giant attracts all sorts of other tiny leaf-eaters too.
+ Unfortenately, marmosets don't eat leaves.
+ And losing a major sap tree is a huge setback. {a watery substance that
  carries food through a plant}
+ But these little gremlins[灌木林s] do have a surprisingly predatory side. {an
  imaginary spirit that is blamed for problems in machinery.}
+ Their spring-loaded legs can launch them up to three-metres.
+ Curved[Curbed] claws grib like mini grappling[grabbling] hooks.
+ And those bark-[昌平] teeth, are just as effective on insects.
